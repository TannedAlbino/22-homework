Project Pitch Ideas

1.  Shipping and post comparison for commercial application.  Using current orders in a database, a shipping method based on cost, time of delivery, and reliability would be calculated throughout all couriers to provide the lowest price possible instead of just individual contracts with one or two couriers.

2. Illuminails - Creating OLED fingernails that communicate via bluetooth and an app that creates and changes displays of each nail to selection.  Hardware component is big, the software development is bigger because of online marketplace and image upload credits.

3.  Gaming table- using large version of Surface Table, RFID readers in chips, cards, and dice, a game and its customers would be able to be tracked creating a user style, preferences, spending habits, etc...
